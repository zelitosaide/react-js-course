/**
 * Fix a broken story tray
 *
 * The CEO of your company is asking you to add “stories” to your online clock
 * app, and you can’t say no. You’ve written a StoryTray component that accepts a
 * list of stories, followed by a “Create Story” placeholder.
 *
 * You implemented the “Create Story” placeholder by pushing one more fake story
 * at the end of the stories array that you receive as a prop. But for some reason,
 * “Create Story” appears more than once. Fix the issue.
