/**
 * Fix a broken clock
 *
 * This component tries to set the <h1>’s CSS class to "night" during the
 * time from midnight to six hours in the morning, and "day" at all other
 * times. However, it doesn’t work. Can you fix this component?
 *
 * You can verify whether your solution works by temporarily changing the
 * computer’s timezone. When the current time is between midnight and six
 * in the morning, the clock should have inverted colors!
