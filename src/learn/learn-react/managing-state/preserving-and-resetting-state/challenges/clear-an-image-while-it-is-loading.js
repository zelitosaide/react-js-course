/**
 * Challenge 4 of 5: Clear an image while it’s loading
 *
 * When you press “Next”, the browser starts loading the next image. However,
 * because it’s displayed in the same <img> tag, by default you would still
 * see the previous image until the next one loads. This may be undesirable if
 * it’s important for the text to always match the image. Change it so that
 * the moment you press “Next”, the previous image immediately clears.
