 * Challenge 1 of 4: Fix a component that’s not updating
 *
 * This Clock component receives two props: color and time. When you
 * select a different color in the select box, the Clock component
 * receives a different color prop from its parent component. However,
 * for some reason, the displayed color doesn’t update. Why? Fix the problem.
