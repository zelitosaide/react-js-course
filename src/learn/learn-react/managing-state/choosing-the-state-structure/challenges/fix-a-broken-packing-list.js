/**
 * Challenge 2 of 4: Fix a broken packing list
 *
 * This packing list has a footer that shows how many items are packed,
 * and how many items there are overall. It seems to work at first, but
 * it is buggy. For example, if you mark an item as packed and then delete
 * it, the counter will not be updated correctly. Fix the counter so that
 * itâ€™s always correct.
