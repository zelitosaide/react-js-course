 * Challenge 4 of 4: Implement useReducer from scratch
 *
 * In the earlier examples, you imported the useReducer Hook from React.
 * This time, you will implement the useReducer Hook itself! Here is a stub
 * to get you started. It shouldnâ€™t take more than 10 lines of code.
 *
 * To test your changes, try typing into the input or select a contact.
